# Challenge 04 - Array Binary Search

## Challenge Summary
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Challenge Description
The search algorithm used in your function should be a binary search.

## Approach & Efficiency
I wrote a function that sets the start and end of the array, then uses a while loop that takes the middle value, then determines if the key is greater or less than this middle value. if greater, we essentially cut the array in half, and run the same loop on the greater half of the array. If the key is smaller, we essentially cut the array down to the loower half and run it on that. We repeat this until we arrive at a place where key === middle value.
