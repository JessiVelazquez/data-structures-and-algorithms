# Challenge 01 - Array Shift
## Challenge Summary
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

## Challenge Description
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index..

## Approach & Efficiency
I took the approach of getting the middle index, then using a for loop with if/else if syntax to push numbers from the original array as well as the provided variable number into the new array at appropriate places.
